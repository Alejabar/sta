Within the Federation, the actual transactions are a trivial matter, but other civilizations still make more overt use of money, with gold-pressed latinum serving as a common economic standard, easily exchanged for the Cardassian lek, Bajoran lita, or Klingon darsek. You’re a part of that galactic economy, providing a service or trading in valua ble goods (or both) in exchange for latinum, currency, or other goods or services in turn.</p><p>Starbases and space stations are a good place to find civilian traders, as they’re hubs of activity that see lots of traffic. Starships—particularly exploratory vessels—may take a trader aboard as a guide or local expert when venturing through unfamiliar regions of space.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Quark (Deep Space Nine), Cleveland \"Book\" Booker (Discovery)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the trait Merchant. This can be adjusted further to reflect the character’s specific profession, such as Bartender or Free Trader.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: You gain a single value, which should reflect the character’s beliefs developed during their career, or which led them to become a merchant in the first place. Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Today’s strangers are tomorrow’s customers</p></li><li><p>When all your needs are met, it’s the experience that matters</p></li><li><p>You wouldn’t begrudge me a little profit in this venture?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: You gain three points, which may be divided among two or three attributes freely (either one gets 2 and the other gets 1, or all three get 1). At least one of the attributes you increase must be Insight or Presence, as a successful trader is often a “people person.”</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS: You increase your Command by 2, and two other departments by 1. In addition, you may reduce one of your other departments by 1 and add that point to any department not already increased.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: You select three focuses. Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Art, Cooking, Psychology, Economics, Logistics, Persuasion, Tailoring, Disruptors</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a single talent.</p></li></ul>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"ownership":{"default":-1,"BsQYuBoOZwvCjdMe":3},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sta.character-lifepath.BnJWNg71sNjz53ay"}},"_stats":{"coreVersion":"10.312","systemId":"sta","systemVersion":"1.2.5","createdTime":1722006513871,"modifiedTime":1724080179741,"lastModifiedBy":"6xWKidE3J8zSAagd"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6xWKidE3J8zSAagd":3},"_id":"nUy4ijHozuyLzUUl"}
