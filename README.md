> Star Trek Adventures Tabletop System in Foundry VTT
</br></br>
<!-- You <b> MUST </b> own the <a href="https://www.modiphius.net/collections/star-trek-adventures/products/star-trek-adventures-core-rulebook-pdf">Star Trek Adventures Tabletop RPG</a> to play this! This system does not attempt to explain the game or include any ready made characters, features or items. The system is designed for those who understand the rules and want to play via Foundry VTT. Modiphius own's the property, as such I will not discuss rules and content with those who have not purchased the system from Modiphius. I am in no way affiliated with Modiphius, I only share this with their permission. -->
